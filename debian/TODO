upstream

   - for next releases -- could you please release source tarballs on NITRC including
     version, not just solar_src.tar.gz, .e.g solar-8.1.1.tar.gz
   - solar or solar-eclipse -- what would be a preferable name to call
     the package?
   - do nifticdf and fslio needed??? I see binding but do not see
     headers included etc.  fslio is a tricky one since copy within
     nifticlib was never updated, and the one coming from FSL is under
     non-free license of FSL ATM, so can't be mixed with GPL'ed projects
   - where libRicVolumed and libNemaVolumed come from?  really
     couldn't find from google
   - minor: some tabs within README.Making* making formatting uncertain

debian:
   - if to use libfslio (from fsl-5.0-core?) would lead to
     incompatibility with GPL
