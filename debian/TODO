   - do nifticdf and fslio needed??? I see binding but do not see
     headers included etc.  fslio is a tricky one since copy within
     nifticlib was never updated, and the one coming from FSL is under
     non-free license of FSL ATM, so can't be mixed with GPL'ed projects

debian:
   - if to use libfslio (from fsl-5.0-core?) would lead to
     incompatibility with GPL
